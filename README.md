- integration with pygbag (Webassambly) to run game in **browser** (also on **mobile** phones - tested on **Android**, currently not working on iOS)
- additional control handling (**touchscreen** and **gamepad**)
- debug features (config and GUI - still in progress)
- regening health when collecting hearts
- **level 4** prepared by my sons (**Tymon & Mateusz**)
- screen resolution detection and fullscreen mode
